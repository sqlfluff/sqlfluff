# SQLFluff-rs

This package is an optional installation for [SQLFluff](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) and is **not** intended to be used as a standalone linting solution.

## Purpose

SQLFluff-rs serves as a Rust-based component that can be integrated with the main SQLFluff package. It is currently in development and should be considered experimental.

## Installation

This package is automatically handled when installing SQLFluff with the appropriate optional dependencies. Direct installation or standalone usage is not supported.

To install from pip:
```sh
pip install sqlfluff[rs]
```

## Development Status

This is a supplementary component and is not meant to replace or function independently of the main SQLFluff package. For SQL linting, please use the main [SQLFluff](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) package.
