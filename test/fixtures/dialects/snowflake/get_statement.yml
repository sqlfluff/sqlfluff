# YML test files are auto-generated from SQL files and should not be edited by
# hand. To help enforce this, the "hash" field in the file must match a hash
# computed by SQLFluff when running the tests. Please run
# `python test/generate_parse_fixture_yml.py`  to generate them after adding or
# altering SQL files.
