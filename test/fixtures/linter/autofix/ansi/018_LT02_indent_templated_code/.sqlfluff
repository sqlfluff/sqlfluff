# TODO: This setting defaults to true. I had to set it false in order to allow a
# rule (LT02) to indent a templated table name. Technically, indenting templated
# code is not "touching" templated code, but in order for SQLFluff to detect
# this and allow the fixes to be applied using default settings,  we'd need to
# tweak some of the anchor and create logic for LintResult.
