**SQLFluff** is a dialect-flexible and configurable SQL linter. Designed
with [ELT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/Extract-Load-Transform-ELT) applications in mind, **SQLFluff** also works with Jinja templating
and dbt. **SQLFluff** will auto-fix most linting errors, allowing you to focus
your time on what matters.

## Dialects Supported

Although SQL is reasonably consistent in its implementations, there are several
different dialects available with variations of syntax and grammar. **SQLFluff**
currently supports the following SQL dialects (though perhaps not in full):

- ANSI SQL - this is the base version and on occasion may not strictly follow
  the ANSI/ISO SQL definition
- [Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)
- [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)
- [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/)
- [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) (note: this extends the `sparksql` dialect with
  [Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html) syntax).
- [Db2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2)
- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)
- [Exasol](https://www.exasol.com/)
- [Greenplum](https://greenplum.org/)
- [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)
- [Impala](https://impala.apache.org/)
- [MariaDB](https://www.mariadb.com/)
- [Materialize](https://materialize.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/index.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (aka Postgres)
- [Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/index.html)
- [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)
- [SOQL](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm)
- [SparkSQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
- [StarRocks](https://www.starrocks.io)
- [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com/)
- [Transact-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference) (aka T-SQL)
- [Trino](https://trino.io/)
- [Vertica](https://www.vertica.com/)

We aim to make it easy to expand on the support of these dialects and also
add other, currently unsupported, dialects. Please [raise issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues)
(or upvote any existing issues) to let us know of demand for missing support.

Pull requests from those that know the missing syntax or dialects are especially
welcomed and are the question way for you to get support added. We are happy
to work with any potential contributors on this to help them add this support.
Please raise an issue first for any large feature change to ensure it is a good
fit for this project before spending time on this work.

## Templates Supported

SQL itself does not lend itself well to [modularity](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/viewpoint#section-modularity),
so to introduce some flexibility and reusability it is often [templated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor)
as discussed more in [our modularity documentation](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/perma/modularity.html).

**SQLFluff** supports the following templates:

- [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) (aka Jinja2)
- SQL placeholders (e.g. SQLAlchemy parameters)
- [Python format strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax)
- [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) (requires plugin)

Again, please raise issues if you wish to support more templating languages/syntaxes.

## VS Code Extension

We also have a VS Code extension:

- [Github Repository](https://github.com/sqlfluff/vscode-sqlfluff)
- [Extension in VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dorzey.vscode-sqlfluff)

# Getting Started

elements (such as the python API) are in a less stable state and may see more
significant changes more often. For details on breaking changes and how
to migrate between versions, see our
[release notes](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/latest/perma/releasenotes.html). See the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more details. If you would like to join in, please
