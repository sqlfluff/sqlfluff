"""This is a modified log capture mechanism which reliably works.

So that logs are handled appropriately by the CLI, sqlfluff
modifies the root logger in a way that can conflict with pytest.

See: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3697

This fixture returns a context manager to handle them better
and enable testing of logs while working around the restrictions
of setting the `propagate` attribute of the logger in each test.
