    NOTE: This mutates the `lines` argument.

    We do this to ensure that templated lines are _somewhat_ consistent.

    Total consistency is very hard, given templated elements
    can be used in a wide range of places. What we do here is
    to try and take a somewhat rules based approach, but also
    one which should fit mostly with user expectations.

    To do this we have three scenarios:
    1. Template tags are already on the same indent.
    2. Template tags aren't, but can be hoisted without
       effectively crossing code to be on the same indent.
       This effectively does the same as "reshuffling"
       placeholders, whitespace and indent segments but
       does so without requiring intervention on the parsed
       file.
    3. Template tags which actively cut across the tree (i.e.
       start and end tags aren't at the same level and can't
       be hoisted). In this case the tags should be indented
       at the lowest indent of the matching set.

    In doing this we have to attempt to match up template
    tags. This might fail. As we battle-test this feature
    there may be some interesting bugs which come up!

    In addition to properly indenting block tags, we also
    filter out any jinja tags which contain newlines because
    if we try and fix them, we'll only fix the *initial*
    part of it. The rest won't be seen because it's within
    the tag.

    TODO: This could be an interesting way to extend the
    indentation algorithm to also cover indentation within
    jinja tags.
