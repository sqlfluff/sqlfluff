class Rule_AL09(BaseRule):
    """Column aliases should not alias to itself, i.e. self-alias.

    Renaming the column to itself is a redundant piece of SQL,
    which doesn't affect its functionality. This rule only applies
    when aliasing to an exact copy of the column reference (e.g.
    :code:`foo as foo` or :code:`"BAR" as "BAR"`, see note below on
    more complex examples). Aliases which effectively change the casing of
    an identifier are still allowed.

    .. note::

       This rule works in conjunction with :sqlfluff:ref:`references.quoting`
       (:sqlfluff:ref:`RF06`) and :sqlfluff:ref:`capitalisation.identifiers`
       (:sqlfluff:ref:`CP02`) to handle self aliases with mixed quoting
       and casing. In the situation that these two rules are not enabled
       then this rule will only fix the strict case where the quoting
       and casing of the alias and reference are the same.

       If those two rules are enabled, the fixes applied may result in a
       situation where this rule can kick in as a secondary effect. For
       example this :ref:`snowflake_dialect_ref` query:

       .. code-block:: sql

          -- Original Query. AL09 will not trigger because casing and
          -- quoting are different. RF06 will however fix the unnecessary
          -- quoting of "COL".
          SELECT "COL" AS col FROM table;
          -- After RF06, the query will look like this, at which point
          -- CP02 will see the inconsistent capitalisation. Depending
          -- on the configuration it will change one of the identifiers.
          -- Let's assume the default configuration of "consistent".
          SELECT COL AS col FROM table;
          -- After CP02, the alias and the reference will be the same
          -- and at this point AL09 can take over and remove the alias.
          SELECT COL AS COL FROM table;
          -- ..resulting in:
          SELECT COL FROM table;

       This interdependence between the rules, and the configuration
       options offered by each one means a variety of outcomes can be
       achieved by enabling and disabling each one. See
       :ref:`ruleselection` and :ref:`ruleconfig` for more details.

    **Anti-pattern**

    Aliasing the column to itself, where not necessary for changing the case
    of an identifier.

    .. code-block:: sql

        SELECT
            col AS col,
            "Col" AS "Col",
            COL AS col
        FROM table;

    **Best practice**

    Not to use alias to rename the column to its original name.
    Self-aliasing leads to redundant code without changing any functionality,
    unless used to effectively change the case of the identifier.

    .. code-block:: sql

        SELECT
            col,
            "Col"
            COL,
        FROM table;

        -- Re-casing aliasing is still allowed where necessary, i.e.
        SELECT
            col as "Col",
            "col" as "COL"
        FROM table;
