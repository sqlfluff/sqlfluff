"""Documenting and validating rule configuration.

Provide a mapping with default configuration options, which are common
to multiple rules with information on valid inputs and definitions.

This mapping is used to validate rule config inputs, as well
as document rule configuration.

It is assumed that most rule bundles will define their own additional
sets of these which should be defined within that bundle rather than
here. Unless your config value is used across multiple bundles, or is
of more general wider use - please define it in the specific plugin
rather than here.
