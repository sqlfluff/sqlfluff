This folder is ignored from the main build and intended
only for files included in others via the `.. include::`
directive.

Some of those files are also auto-generated by scripts,
in which case they should be included in the `.gitignore`
and not edited by hand.

See [generate-rule-docs.py](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/blob/main/docs/generate-rule-docs.py) for more info.
