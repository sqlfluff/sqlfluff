Internal API
============

Anything within this section should only be necessary for people who are
developing plugins or rules to interact with SQLFluff on a deeper level or
people who've decided to help the project by
:ref:`contributing to SQLFluff <development>`.

As these docs are some of the least commonly used, you may find that not
all modules are documented directly here, and so you may find it instructive
to read this together with docstrings and comments directly within the
SQLFluff codebase on `GitHub`_.
